      The round light object "Japanese paper" with a diameter of 90 cm and a copper-colored frame is covered with an
      original Japanese white Shoji paper and is illuminated from inside (multicolored).
    </p>
    <p>
      Shoji-papers are traditionally used in Japan for covering sliding doors and, due to their translucency, are also
      very well suited for luminaries' construction. This shoji paper is natural white and has a very nice hemp
      fiber-water drop structure.
    </p>

      The frame has been treated with several layers of sheet metal (gilded metal) and connected to the shoji paper on
      the front by a narrow copper rim.
    </p>

      Inside, the luminary is covered with over 500 individual RGB LEDs and illuminated evenly, so that the individual
      drops of water and hemp fibers show up very well.

      The light can be controlled and dimmed via a remote control. It can be selected over 16 different shades by
      remote
      control.
