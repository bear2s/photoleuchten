    <p>The round light object "Skycrystal NYC" with a diameter of 88 cm and a hand painted frame is lit from the inside
    (white).</p>
    <p>The motif is a close-up of a thick, textured glass front that was shot high above the rooftops of New York
    City.</p>
    <p>On the round frame several layers of white, iron and rust colors are applied, which melt into each other and are
    reflected in the colors of the picture.</p>
    <p>The motif is applied to a sheet of acrylic glass by means of a foil and illuminated by means of white LED
    modules.
    Due to the lighting, the glass structures and colors gain additional depth and shine.</p>
    <p>The light can be controlled and dimmed via a remote control.</p>
