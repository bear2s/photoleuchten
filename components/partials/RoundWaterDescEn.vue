      The round light object "Water" with a diameter of 90 cm and a copper-colored, oxidized frame is lit from the
      inside (white).
    </p>
    <p>
      The motif is a water close-up with various blue and single yellow tones, which is applied as a foil on a round
      acrylic glass plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the round frame several layers of copper (striking metal) are applied ("gold plated").
    </p>
    <p>
      The copper was oxidized in several steps and treated with faceted lacquer, so that a very beautiful turquoise
      tone was created on the copper, which combines with the image motif.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside, the luminary is covered with white LED modules and evenly illuminated, which makes the individual colors
      of the water stand out very well, producing different images depending on the lighting intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light can be controlled and dimmed via a remote control.
