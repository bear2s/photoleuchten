    <p>The photo wall lights "Square" have a format of 53 cm x 53 cm x 6 cm. They are mains powered with a subtle white cable running from below the frame.</p>

    <p>Each wooden frame is unique piece of carpentry with a round or square cutout and painted white.</p>

    <p>The motifs are printed on backlit film and fixed on an acrylic glass plate as a support, so that the illumination gives a particularly beautiful plastic effect.</p>

    <p>In coordination with the respective motif, the luminaries are equipped with warm or cold white LEDs which, in combination with the printed photo, emit an atmospheric light which can be adjusted to be brighter or darker by remote control.</p>

    <p>Upon request, customer-specific photos can also be printed in the appropriate format and be attached in the luminaries so that an individual unique piece is created.</p>
