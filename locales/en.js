    `The photo-light boxes "Square" have a format of 42 cm x 42 cm x 8 cm. They are powered by batteries that are hidden in the frame. This makes the light boxes very flexible - they can be hung on the wall, placed on the floor or on a shelf.`,
    `Each wooden frame is unique piece of carpentry with a square cut and painted white.`,
    `As motifs, there are detailed photographs, e. g. "Salt & Pepper" or different nature photographs. In the "motif selection" a photo can be selected.`,
    `The photos are printed on a sheet of acrylic glass and illuminated from the inside with white LEDs.`,
    `Upon request, customer-specific photos can also be printed in the appropriate format and be attached in the luminaries so that an individual unique piece is created.`

  water_desc: `The "water" light object has a water close-up motif with different shades of blue and single yellow tones. The motif is is applied with a foil to a round acrylic glass plate. The luminaire is internally lined with white LEDs on ribbons and is thereby illuminated very evenly so that the individual water drops and hemp fibers are very effective. The light can be controlled and dimmed via a remote control.
                The outer frame was treated with several layers of copper (impact metal) ("gilded"). The copper was oxidized in several steps and worked with varnish so that a very beautiful turquoise on the copper was created, which connects nicely with the picture.`,
