  quad_desc: `The square light boxes are battery powered and very flexible - they can be hung on the wall, placed on the floor or on a shelf.
              As motifs, there are detailed photographs, e.g. "Salt & Pepper" or different nature photographs.
              The motif is printed on an acrylic glass plate and fixed from the inside with picture clips. It can be replaced easily. Each frame is a single piece of carpentry.
              `,
  quad_linepower_desc: `
    The square line-powered light boxes are slightly larger than the battery-powered and are designed for wall mounting.
    Each frame is unique, made of wood by a joiner and has a round or square cutout.
    The motifs are printed on backlit foil and fixed on an acrylic glass plate as a carrier, so that the lighting gives a particularly beautiful plastic effect. The light boxes are equipped with warm or cold - white LEDs, which, in conjunction with the printed photo, allow them to emit a powerful light, which can be adjusted by the remote control depending on the mood. 
    On request, customer-specific photos can also be printed in the appropriate format and installed in the luminaire, so that an individual piece can be produced.

  japanpaper_desc: `The lamp "Japanpapier" is covered with an original Japanese soy paper. Sojipaptes are traditionally used in Japan for covering sliding doors and are also very well suited for luminaire construction because of their translucence. This soy paper is natural white and has a very nice hemp water droplet structure.
                    The interior is covered with over 500 individual RGB LEDs on tapes and is therefore very evenly illuminated, so that the individual water drops and hemp fibers are very effective. The light can be dimmed via a remote control and controlled via 16 different colors.
                    The outer frame was worked ("gilded") with several layers of copper (impact metal) and connected to the soy paper by a small copper edge on the front side.`,
  water_desc: `The "water" light object has a water close-up motif with different shades of blue and single yellow tones. The motif is is applied with a foil to a round acrylic glass plate. The luminaire is internally lined with white LEDs on ribbons and is thereby illuminated very evenly so that the individual water drops and hemp fibers are very effective. The light can be controlled and dimmed via a remote control.
                The outer frame was treated with several layers of copper (impact metal) ("gilded"). The copper was oxidized in several steps and worked with varnish so that a very beautiful turquoise on the copper was created, which connects nicely with the picture.`,
