          Here you will find handcrafted lights made with love: wall lights, light objects, light boxes with photographs
          that look great unlit and get a whole new look when illuminated.</p>
        <p>
          Due to their different motifs, light colors and strengths, the luminaries fit into many living areas and bring
          a new atmosphere into a room.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for an individual piece for residential or business premises, which brings a special,
          beautiful light in a room, you are in the right place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wall lights and light objects come in different formats and sizes. All lights are equipped with
          energy-saving LED technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Special designs with your own motif or in certain sizes are possible at any time.
